SeaSeeAI Project Status - Mentor Meeting

COMPLETED:
✅ Project structure setup
✅ Virtual environment configured  
✅ AIS data simulation working
✅ Data preprocessing pipeline
✅ LSTM model architecture
✅ Training framework ready

CURRENT ISSUE:
⚠️  Model shape mismatch being fixed

READY TO DEMO:
- Project repository structure
- Data generation pipeline
- Model architecture design
- Training workflow

NEXT STEPS:
- Fix model output shape
- Train first model
- Generate predictions
- Create visualizations

IMMEDIATE ASKS:
1. Data source recommendations?
2. Model architecture feedback?
3. Evaluation metric priorities?
